    "#Question :1\n",
    " #class and object with respect to object oriented programming.\n",
    " #In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of the class. A class defines a set of \n",
    " #attributes (also called properties) and methods that characterize the behavior of objects created from it.\n",
    "\n",
    " #For example, imagine a class called \"Car\" that defines the properties and behaviors of a car, such as its make, model, year, color, and methods\n",
    " #like starting the engine, accelerating, and braking.\n",
    "\n",
    " #An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class that has specific values assigned to its properties. For instance, an object of the \"Car\"\n",
    " #class could be an actual car with a make of \"Thar\" ,a model of \"LX4 str\" ,a year of \"2020\", and a color of \"Black\".\n",
